# Folder cleanup script with exceptions list

Cleanup old folders within a folder. Add exceptions list of directories you wish to preserve. One directory per line.

**Currently does not support exceptions containing whitespace - PR welcome**

See `make help` for possible options.

Provide environment variable like this: `FOLDER_PATH=/full/path/to/folder make folder/check`
